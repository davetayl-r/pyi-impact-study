What is your current role (program manager, executive manager, administrator) in relation to PYI?\n\nThe types of services offered\n\nWhat is it? — The types of services offered are important because the different attributes (complexity, adaptability, cost, evidence strength and quality and design quality) of the services will influence how easy it can be taken up by individuals and service provider agencies.\nIndicative talking points:\n\nWhat are some troubles that your clients face?\nWhat do you do to help clients?\nIs there anything you can’t do?\n\n\nThe Individuals involved\n\nWhat is it? — The individuals involved in implementing the service are important because their skills, expertise, attitudes, behaviours and values influence how they engage in the implementation process and how the organisation setting operates.\nIndicative talking points:\n\nHow were the PYI guidelines interpreted by your team?\nWhat are they three things that they do always?\nHow do they work together?\n\n\nThe external context\n\nWhat is it? — The organisation’s outer context is important because funding structures, legislation, policy agendas and similar factors in the environment of the implementation can change or totally stop an implementation.\nIndicative talking points:\n\nWhat challenges did you experience outside of your workplace (i.e. outside your control) that have made it difficult to implement PYI?\nAre you able to get the things they need in a timely fashion?\nAre there things that they need that you can’t get them?\n\n\nThe organisational context\n\nWhat is it? — The organisation setting in which the service is implemented is important because factors such as hierarchical structures, culture, communication and access to training and resources will influence how quickly and easily a new program can be taken up and utilised by an organisation.\nIndicative talking points:\n\nIn what ways were service providers well-prepared to deliver PYI?\nHow do you know what your clients need?\n\n\nThe quality of the implementation process\n\nWhat is it? — The quality of the implementation process itself is important because the attention paid, resources invested, and commitment made to an implementation process will enhance, or diminish, the likelihood of its success.\nIndicative talking points:\n\nHow did the process of implementing the PYI work?\nWhat are you doing that works to improve outcomes for your clients?\n\n\nOverall\n\nDo you have any other feedback on how PYI could be strengthened to better meet the needs of the young people it seeks to support?

The CFIR is a meta-theoretical framework that synthesises information and evidence about constructs and domains that affect implementation processes.\nImplementation enablers and barriers can be related to five different areas: the types of services offered; the individuals involved in implementing the service; the organisational setting in which the service is implemented; the organisations outer context; and the quality of the implementation process itself. We are interested in obtaining your input about which areas you think are key challenges or enablers in the implementation of PYI.\nNote: This discussion guide is indicative and may not be reflective of the exact content\n\nThe types of services offered\n\nWhat is it? — The types of services offered are important because the different attributes (complexity, adaptability, cost, evidence strength and quality and design quality) of the services will influence how easy it can be taken up by individuals and service provider agencies.\nSpecific questions:\n\nIn what context was PYI developed?\nHow was this population served before PYI? • How did it fit into the broader policy/reform context?\nWhat decisions led to the current model being pursued?\n\n\nThe Individuals involved\n\nWhat is it? — The individuals involved in implementing the service are important because their skills, expertise, attitudes, behaviours and values influence how they engage in the implementation process and how the organisation setting operates.\nSpecific questions:\n\nHow were the program’s goals decided?\nHow was local demand for services estimated in each location?\n\n\nThe external context\n\nWhat is it? — The organisation’s outer context is important because funding structures, legislation, policy agendas and similar factors in the environment of the implementation can change or totally stop an implementation.\nSpecific questions:\n\nBy the time they left care, what did DCJ envision PYI clients would be prepared for by their case workers?\n\n\nThe organisational context\n\nWhat is it? — The organisation setting in which the service is implemented is important because factors such as hierarchical structures, culture, communication and access to training and resources will influence how quickly and easily a new program can be taken up and utilised by an organisation.\nSpecific questions:\n\nWhat does a successful outcome for PYI clients look like from DCJ’s perspective?\n\n\nThe quality of the implementation process\n\nWhat is it? — The quality of the implementation process itself is important because the attention paid, resources invested, and commitment made to an implementation process will enhance, or diminish, the likelihood of its success.\nSpecific questions:\n\nDid you think the CIT and DIT structure suited the needs of this project?\nWhat elements of this structure/process do you think worked well?\n\n\nOverall\n\n\nDo you have any thoughts on how PYI could be strengthened to better meet the needs of the young people it seeks to support? Please explain."

It displays the standardized mean differences (SMDs) for each covariate included in the matching model, providing a scale-independent measure of balance that is unaffected by sample size. Covariate balance is essential for causal inference, as it ensures that intervention and comparison groups are sufficiently comparable, reducing sensitivity to model misspecification and improving the validity of treatment effect estimates. Prior to matching, six of nine covariates exceeded the commonly recommended threshold of 0.1 SMD, indicating poor balance; however, both matching methods improved balance substantially, with full matching achieving excellent balance across all covariates.\n\n\n\nFigure S1: Distribution of propensity scores under different matching specifications\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAssessing common support\nThe common support assumption requires that the probability of receiving treatment conditional on covariates \\(X\\) lies strictly between 0 and 1: \\(0 &lt; P(D=1|X) &lt; 1\\) where \\(D\\) is the treatment indicator and \\(X\\) represents the vector of covariates used for matching. This condition requires that there is overlap in the distribution of propensity scores between those who receive the intervention and comparison across the range of scores, in order for a counterfactual to be valid (Heckman, Ichimura, & Todd, 1997). We assessed this visually using a balance plot (Figure S2), which shows the distribution of propensity scores for the intervention and comparison groups under both matching specifications. The plot shows that both specifications achieve substantial overlap in the propensity score distributions between individuals in the intervention and comparison samples, suggesting the analysis meets the common support assumption.\n\n\n\nFigure S2: Distribution of propensity scores under different matching specifications"

    "text": "Sensitivity analysis\nWe conducted sensitivity analyses for unmeasured confounding on binary outcomes using tipping point analysis using tipr (McGowan, 2022). In Table S16, we present the results of three scenarios (low, medium, high) where the potential unmeasured confounder-exposure relationship was calibrated based on the observed minimum and maximum prevalence differences of measured confounders in our unmatched sample. Since we did not detect any precise ATT estimates, the results of this analysis indicate the strength of confounder-outcome relationships that would be required to flip the sign of our point estimates under different scenarios (noting that their confidence intervals already span zero). For binary outcomes assessed under full matching, an unmeasured confounder would need to have a relationship with the outcome between 0.3-1.0 times that of the treatment-outcome relationship to reverse the direction of the observed point estimate. The required relationships are substantially larger for nearest neighbour specifications, ranging from 1.3-2.9 times the treatment-outcome relationship.\n\n\n\nTable S16: Results of tipping point
