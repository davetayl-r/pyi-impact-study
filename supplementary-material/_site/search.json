    "text": "4.1 Matching diagnostic tests\n\n4.1.1 Assessing sample balance\nFigure 1 presents a love plot, a diagnostic tool for assessing covariate balance before and after matching. It displays the standardized mean differences (SMDs) for each covariate included in the matching model, providing a scale-independent measure of balance that is unaffected by sample size. Covariate balance is essential for causal inference, as it ensures that intervention and comparison groups are sufficiently comparable, reducing sensitivity to model misspecification and improving the validity of treatment effect estimates. Prior to matching, six of nine covariates exceeded the commonly recommended threshold of 0.1 SMD, indicating poor balance; however, both matching methods improved balance substantially, with full matching achieving excellent balance across all covariates.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Distribution of propensity scores under different matching specifications\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.1.2 Assessing common support\nThe common support assumption requires that the probability of receiving treatment conditional on covariates \\(X\\) lies strictly between 0 and 1: \\(0 &lt; P(D=1|X) &lt; 1\\) where \\(D\\) is the treatment indicator and \\(X\\) represents the vector of covariates used for matching. This condition requires that there is overlap in the distribution of propensity scores between those who receive the intervention and comparison across the range of scores, in order for a counterfactual to be valid (Heckman, Ichimura, & Todd, 1997). We assessed this visually using a balance plot (Figure 2), which shows the distribution of propensity scores for the intervention and comparison groups under both matching specifications. The plot shows that both specifications achieve substantial overlap in the propensity score distributions between individuals in the intervention and comparison samples, suggesting the analysis meets the common support assumption.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Distribution of propensity scores under different matching specifications"
