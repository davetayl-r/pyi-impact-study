Details of focus groups with intervention participants
:::

### Recruitment and consent process

<h4>Invitation</h4>

-   The Evaluation Team contacted providers by email in September 2019 and requested their assistance to identify and approach clients who might be willing to participate in a focus group to discuss PYI
-   Additional contact was made with provider contacts to answer questions and clarify the content and scope of the focus group

<h4>Recruitment</h4>

-   Young people receiving PYI services, aged 18 years or older, were invited by their PYI providers to participate in a focus group on the PYI program (PYI providers were provided with an explanatory statement, consent forms and protocol to assist in the recruitment of young people for interview)
-   Providers used the Explanatory Statement approved by the Monash University Human Research Ethics Committee to inform young people about the purpose and nature of the focus group and invite them to participate

<h4>Focus groups</h4>

-   Focus groups were held in-person at or near the PYI providers usual place of business
-   Sessions lasted for between 60 minutes
-   Sessions were facilitated by two experienced qualitative researchers from CEI — one of whom had qualifications in either social work or psychology — who shared roles as moderator and scribe
-   A semi-structured protocol was developed to guide discussion — it is included in @sec-participant-protocol.

<h4>Consent</h4>

-   Prior to the focus group participants were provided with a copy of the Explanatory Statement, consent details and focus group protocol
-   The facilitator verbally went through the explanatory statement and consent procedures prior to commencement
-   Participants signed a consent form with one copy retained by the participant and one retained by the facilitator
-   Young people who provided consent to participate in the focus groups were provided with a gift voucher — not redeemable for alcohol or tobacco products — valued at \$25
-   Respondent feedback was recorded by hand by facilitators anonymously to protect the confidentiality of respondents

### Focus group protocol {#sec-participant-protocol}

    -   assisting you to grow your support network?
-   Is there anything they could have done differently?

<h4>Transitional support</h4>

-   Have you all met with your transitional support worker?
-   Did your transitional support worker help you by:
    -   asking about your accommodation needs?
    -   assisting with securing accommodation by working with a real estate agent or community housing provider?
-   Is there anything they could have done differently?

<h4>Education and employment mentoring</h4>

-   How did they help you?
-   Did they help you by:
    -   Choosing education and employment goals?
    -   Helping you apply for education / jobs?
-   Is there anything they could have done differently?

<h4>General feedback</h4>

-   Were you able to get help when you needed it?
-   Would you like to add anything about stuff that’s been challenging for you, that you would like to see improved with PYI?
-   Is there anything about stuff that you really enjoy about PYI that you would like to see more of?

<h4>Overall</h4>

#### PYI housing providers

Housing provision for participants was managed either through a dedicated role within the service provider organisation or by a separate organization for those operating within a consortium. Interviews with housing provider representatives were conducted independently from service provider interviews due to their distinct focus. These interviews were conducted virtually via Zoom due to COVID-19 social distancing restrictions in place at the time. All housing providers except one participated in the interviews. Details of the interviews are summarised in Table @supptbl-interviews-housing-providers.

:::

### Recruitment and consent process

<h4>Invitation:</h4>

-   The Evaluation Team contacted PYI providers by email in August and September 2019 to provide information about the focus groups and their scope.
-   The Evaluation Team contacted PYI housing providers by email in August 2020 to provide information about the focus groups and their scope.
-   Additional contact was made with provider contacts to answer questions and clarify the content and scope of the focus groups.

<h4>Recruitment:</h4>

-   Providers were emailed a copy of the Explanatory Statement and focus group protocol approved by the Monash University Human Research Ethics Committee and asked to review it and identify the individuals within their organisation who were best placed to provide input.
-   The Evaluation Team liaised with providers to find a mutually beneficial date and time to hold the focus group.

<h4>Consent:</h4>

-   Prior to the focus group participants were provided with a copy of the Explanatory Statement, consent details and protocol
-   The facilitator verbally went through the explanatory statement and consent procedures prior to commencement

### Focus group protocol

We have developed a protocol based upon the domains of the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR). The CFIR is a meta-theoretical framework that synthesises information and evidence about constructs and domains that affect implementation processes.

Implementation enablers and barriers can be related to five different areas: the types of services offered; the individuals involved in implementing the service; the organisation setting in which the service is implemented; the organisations outer context; and the quality of the implementation process itself. In the focus group, we will briefly discuss the five areas that impact implementation and then ask for your input about which areas you think are key challenges or enablers for PYI service providers.

*Note:* This discussion guide is indicative and may not be reflective of the exact content

<h4>Purpose and consent</h4>

Evaluation Team to provide brief overview of the purpose of the focus group and how it will be used to inform the evaluation. Verbal consent will be obtained in order to record the teleconference and use the information provided to inform our evaluation findings.

<h4>Introductions</h4>

Please introduce yourself to the group and tell us how long you have been involved with the Premiers Youth Initiative (PYI). What is your current role (program manager, executive manager, administrator) in relation to PYI?

<h4>The types of services offered</h4>

*What is it?* — The types of services offered are important because the different attributes (complexity, adaptability, cost, evidence strength and quality and design quality) of the services will influence how easy it can be taken up by individuals and service provider agencies.

*Indicative talking points:*

-   What are some troubles that your clients face?
-   What do you do to help clients?
-   Is there anything you can’t do?

<h4>The Individuals involved</h4>

*What is it?* — The individuals involved in implementing the service are important because their skills, expertise, attitudes, behaviours and values influence how they engage in the implementation process and how the organisation setting operates.

*Indicative talking points:*

-   How were the PYI guidelines interpreted by your team?
-   What are they three things that they do always?
-   How do they work together?

<h4>The external context</h4>

*What is it?* — The organisation’s outer context is important because funding structures, legislation, policy agendas and similar factors in the environment of the implementation can change or totally stop an implementation.

*Indicative talking points:*

-   What challenges did you experience outside of your workplace (i.e. outside your control) that have made it difficult to implement PYI?
-   Are you able to get the things they need in a timely fashion?
-   Are there things that they need that you can’t get them?

<h4>The organisational context</h4>

*What is it?* — The organisation setting in which the service is implemented is important because factors such as hierarchical structures, culture, communication and access to training and resources will influence how quickly and easily a new program can be taken up and utilised by an organisation.

*Indicative talking points:*

-   In what ways were service providers well-prepared to deliver PYI?
-   How do you know what your clients need?

<h4>The quality of the implementation process</h4>

*What is it?* — The quality of the implementation process itself is important because the attention paid, resources invested, and commitment made to an implementation process will enhance, or diminish, the likelihood of its success.

*Indicative talking points:*

-   How did the process of implementing the PYI work?
-   What are you doing that works to improve outcomes for your clients?

<h4>Overall</h4>

Do you have any other feedback on how PYI could be strengthened to better meet the needs of the young people it seeks to support? Please explain.

## Focus groups with representatives from the funder {#sec-qualitative-sample-funder}

### Participant details

The intervention was developed and funded by the NSW Department of Communities and Justice (DCJ). Program oversight was managed by the central office in Sydney, while day-to-day engagement between the funding body and service providers was coordinated by district-level representatives. Focus group participants included the program manager (from the central office) and contract managers from all districts where the intervention was implemented. These focus groups were conducted virtually via Zoom due to COVID-19 social distancing restrictions in place at the time. Details are summarised in @supptbl-focus-group-funder.

### Recruitment and consent process

<h4>Invitation:</h4>

-   Representatives from the funder were nominated by the program manager at DCJ central office.
-   The Evaluation Team contacted nominated contacts by email in August 2020 to provide information about the focus groups and their scope.

<h4>Recruitment:</h4>

-   Nominated representatives from DCJ were emailed a copy of the Explanatory Statement and protocol approved by the Monash University Human Research Ethics Committee and asked to review it prior to the focus group.
-   The Evaluation Team liaised with representatives from DCJ to find a mutually beneficial date and time to hold the focus group.

<h4>Consent:</h4>

-   The facilitator verbally went through the explanatory statement and consent procedures prior to commencement

### Protocol

We have compiled a series of questions based upon the domains of the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR). The CFIR is a meta-theoretical framework that synthesises information and evidence about constructs and domains that affect implementation processes.

Implementation enablers and barriers can be related to five different areas: the types of services offered; the individuals involved in implementing the service; the organisational setting in which the service is implemented; the organisations outer context; and the quality of the implementation process itself. We are interested in obtaining your input about which areas you think are key challenges or enablers in the implementation of PYI.

*Note:* This discussion guide is indicative and may not be reflective of the exact content

<h4>The types of services offered</h4>

*What is it?* — The types of services offered are important because the different attributes (complexity, adaptability, cost, evidence strength and quality and design quality) of the services will influence how easy it can be taken up by individuals and service provider agencies.

*Specific questions:*

-   In what context was PYI developed?
-   How was this population served before PYI? • How did it fit into the broader policy/reform context?
-   What decisions led to the current model being pursued?

<h4>The Individuals involved</h4>

*What is it?* — The individuals involved in implementing the service are important because their skills, expertise, attitudes, behaviours and values influence how they engage in the implementation process and how the organisation setting operates.

*Specific questions:*

-   How were the program’s goals decided?
-   How was local demand for services estimated in each location?

<h4>The external context</h4>

*What is it?* — The organisation’s outer context is important because funding structures, legislation, policy agendas and similar factors in the environment of the implementation can change or totally stop an implementation.

*Specific questions:*

-   By the time they left care, what did DCJ envision PYI clients would be prepared for by their case workers?

<h4>The organisational context</h4>

*What is it?* — The organisation setting in which the service is implemented is important because factors such as hierarchical structures, culture, communication and access to training and resources will influence how quickly and easily a new program can be taken up and utilised by an organisation.

*Specific questions:*

-   What does a successful outcome for PYI clients look like from DCJ’s perspective?

<h4>The quality of the implementation process</h4>

*What is it?* — The quality of the implementation process itself is important because the attention paid, resources invested, and commitment made to an implementation process will enhance, or diminish, the likelihood of its success.

*Specific questions:*

-   Did you think the CIT and DIT structure suited the needs of this project?
-   What elements of this structure/process do you think worked well?

<h4>Overall</h4>

-   Do you have any thoughts on how PYI could be strengthened to better meet the needs of the young people it seeks to support? Please explain.

## Matching diagnostic tests {#sec-match-diagnostic}

### Assessing sample balance

@suppfig-pyi-love-plot presents a love plot, a diagnostic tool for assessing covariate balance before and after matching. It displays the standardized mean differences (SMDs) for each covariate included in the matching model, providing a scale-independent measure of balance that is unaffected by sample size. Covariate balance is essential for causal inference, as it ensures that intervention and comparison groups are sufficiently comparable, reducing sensitivity to model misspecification and improving the validity of treatment effect estimates. Prior to matching, six of nine covariates exceeded the commonly recommended threshold of 0.1 SMD, indicating poor balance; however, both matching methods improved balance substantially, with full matching achieving excellent balance across all covariates.

Distribution of propensity scores under different matching specifications
:::

### Assessing common support

The common support assumption requires that the probability of receiving treatment conditional on covariates $X$ lies strictly between 0 and 1: $0 < P(D=1|X) < 1$ where $D$ is the treatment indicator and $X$ represents the vector of covariates used for matching. This condition requires that there is overlap in the distribution of propensity scores between those who receive the intervention and comparison across the range of scores, in order for a counterfactual to be valid [@heckman1997matchingeconometricevaluation]. We assessed this visually using a balance plot (@suppfig-pyi-halfmoon-plot), which shows the distribution of propensity scores for the intervention and comparison groups under both matching specifications. The plot shows that both specifications achieve substantial overlap in the propensity score distributions between individuals in the intervention and comparison samples, suggesting the analysis meets the common support assumption.

## Sensitivity analysis {#sec-sensitivity-analysis}

We conducted sensitivity analyses for unmeasured confounding on binary outcomes using tipping point analysis using `tipr` [@mcgowan2022tiprpackagesensitivity]. In @supptbl-pyi-sensitivity-analysis-tip, we present the results of three scenarios (low, medium, high) where the potential unmeasured confounder-exposure relationship was calibrated based on the observed minimum and maximum prevalence differences of measured confounders in our unmatched sample. Since we did not detect any precise ATT estimates, the results of this analysis indicate the strength of confounder-outcome relationships that would be required to flip the sign of our point estimates under different scenarios (noting that their confidence intervals already span zero). For binary outcomes assessed under full matching, an unmeasured confounder would need to have a relationship with the outcome between 0.3-1.0 times that of the treatment-outcome relationship to reverse the direction of the observed point estimate. The required relationships are substantially larger for nearest neighbour specifications, ranging from 1.3-2.9 times the treatment-outcome relationship.
